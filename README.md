## ðŸ”¢ What is Project Euler?

> Project Euler is a collection of challenging mathematical and computational problems designed to be solved using computer programs. It emphasizes efficiency and elegant logic.

## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. **Clone this repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/project-euler.git
   cd project-euler

2. **Run a problem solution (based on language)**:
   Python:

   ```bash
   python problem002.py
   ```
   C++:

   ```bash
   g++ problem001.cpp -o problem001
   ./problem001
   ```
   Java:

   ```bash
   javac Problem003.java
   java Problem003
   ```

Let me know if you'd like me to:
- Add a **problem index table**
- Include example solutions (`problem001.py`, etc.)
- Generate a `.gitignore` or `LICENSE`

I can customize this further based on how you structure your files.
